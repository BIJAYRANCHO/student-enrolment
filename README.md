# student-enrolment
Your task is to design and implement a program that manages student information stored in three separate files, and extracts a report for each student AND a summary for each course. The content of the files is as follows:  students.txt – This file contains unique student records consisting of the student identity number, surname and first name.  courses.csv – This file contains unique course records in a comma separated (.csv) file. Each record is described by course code, course description/title and the weighting of the continuous assessment (CA) and examination marks. The weighting/rate is a value between 0 and 1, and the sum of CA and examination weighting must be equal to 1.  enrolments.txt – Each student can register/enrol in one or more courses, and each course can be taken by many students. This file contains the details of each student registration/enrolment including the student identity number, course code, the CA mark and examination mark.
